You define the rules, the plugin checks them. The first one to pass wins.\n\n\nApplySyntax allows you to create your own custom rules. The easiest way to get started is to create a settings file called \nApplySyntax.sublime-settings\n in your \nPackages/User\n folder.  You can override the default settings in \nPackages/ApplySyntax/ApplySyntax.sublime-settings\n by setting them in your \nPackages/User/ApplySyntax.sublime-settings\n file. You can override any setting to meet your needs.  To append rules to the default rule set, you can create a key called \nsyntaxes\n (modifying \ndefault_syntaxes\n will wipe out all the default rules and is not recommended as you won\nt get the latest updates).\n\n\nCreating Rules\n\n\nEach rule is a dictionary within the syntax array.  Let\ns take a look at the top level parameters.\n\n\nName\n\n\nname\n is the syntax file that will be applied to a view which meets the criteria defined in the rule.\n\n\nFor syntax files you must specify the path to the syntax file. The plugin is capable of supporting multiple levels of folder nesting if you need it to. For example, if you had all of your tmLanguage files for Rails organized in a folder like this: \nPackages/Rails/Language/*.tmLanguage\n, and you were looking to use the \nRuby Haml.tmLanguage\n file, the path to name translation would simply be: \nPackages/Rails/Language/Ruby Haml.tmLanguage\n -\n \nRails/Language/Ruby Haml\n.\n\n\nname\n:\n \nRails/Language/Ruby Haml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the paths are relative to the \nPackages\n folder.  Also, notice that we don\nt specify the extension.  Sublime Text in build 3084 added a new language syntax with the extension \nsublime-syntax\n.  In Sublime builds \n= 3084, ApplySyntax will first default to \nsublime-syntax\n and fall back to \ntmLanguage\n if it cannot find the the other format.  If you want to force the syntax, just specify the extension; the extension must be either \nsublime-syntax\n or \ntmlanguage\n.\n\n\nname\n:\n \nRails/Language/Ruby Haml.tmLanguage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it is desirable for the syntax rule to reference multiple tmLanguage files because it is not known which package will be on a machine, you can set the syntax as an array of names as shown in the following example.  The first one found will be used.\n\n\nname\n:\n \n[\nRSpec/RSpec\n,\n \nRSpec (snippets and syntax)/Syntaxes/RSpec\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that each syntax file has a different path since they come from completely different plugins.\n\n\nExtensions\n\n\nextensions\n is a convenience option to add a given set of extensions to your language settings file.  By adding the extension to the language settings file, sidebar icons in ST3 will display the proper icon, and files will load with the proper syntax via Sublime\ns default extension detection method.  Keep in mind though that other rules can override this. \nextensions\n isn\nt really a rule, but just a list which ApplySyntax uses to automatically add extension to the language settings file.  A match within this array won\nt currently stop ApplySyntax from processing rules since it is not evaluated as a rule (this may change in the future).\n\n\nApply syntax will create a file \nApplySyntax.ext-list\n in your \nUser\n folder and track which extension it added so that if you remove a rule, ApplySyntax will only remove the extensions it added to the language file in question.\n\n\nIf you do not like this functionality, you can simply disable it by setting the following option in your settings file to \nfalse\n:\n\n\n    \nadd_exts_to_lang_settings\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nextensions\n will not work in a \nproject specific rule\n.\n\n\n\n\nMatch\n\n\nmatch\n is a setting that you either include or omit.  When included, you set it to \nall\n.  When set, all rules defined must be met for a match to be considered successful.  \nmatch\n ignores the \nextensions\n key as it is not actually a rule.\n\n\n    \nmatch\n:\n \nall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo in this case, all the rules must match for the syntax to be applied:\n\n\n     \nname\n:\n \nHandlebars/Handlebars\n,\n\n     \nmatch\n:\n \nall\n,\n\n     \nrules\n:\n \n[\n\n         \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*\\\\.html$\n},\n\n         \n{\ncontains\n:\n \nscript [^\n]*type=\\\ntext\\\\/x-handlebars\\\n[^\n]*\n}\n\n     \n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, there is no \nmatch\n key, so only one rule needs to match:\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nname\n:\n \nRuby/Ruby\n,\n\n        \nextensions\n:\n \n[\nthor\n,\n \nrake\n,\n \nsimplecov\n,\n \njbuilder\n,\n \nrb\n,\n \npodspec\n,\n \nrabl\n],\n\n        \nrules\n:\n \n[\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*(\\\\\\\\|/)Gemfile$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*(\\\\\\\\|/)Capfile$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*(\\\\\\\\|/)Guardfile$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*(\\\\\\\\|/)[Rr]akefile$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*(\\\\\\\\|/)Berksfile$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*(\\\\\\\\|/)[Cc]heffile$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*(\\\\\\\\|/)Thorfile$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*(\\\\\\\\|/)Podfile$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*(\\\\\\\\|/)config.ru$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*\\\\\\\\Vagrantfile(\\\\\\\\..*)?$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*/Vagrantfile(/..*)?$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*\\\\.thor$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*\\\\.rake$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*\\\\.simplecov$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*\\\\.jbuilder$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*\\\\.rb$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*\\\\.podspec$\n},\n\n            \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*\\\\.rabl$\n},\n\n            \n{\nbinary\n:\n \nruby\n}\n\n        \n]\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRules\n\n\nrules\n is an array of rules that can be used to target specific files with your defined syntax file.  The rules are processed until the first rule matches, so order your rules in a way that makes sense to you.\n\n\nFile Name Rule\n\n\nA \nfile_name\n rule defines a regex to match against the complete file path. The pattern is always anchored to the beginning of the path, as if there were an implicit \n^\n \u2014 so the pattern \n/a/b/c\n will match the file \n/a/b/c/foo.py\n, but not the file \n/x/y/z/a/b/c/foo.py\n. (You may include an explicit \n^\n at the beginning of the pattern, as some of the default rules do \u2014 but the result is the same either way.)\n\n\n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*\\\\.xml(\\\\.dist)?$\n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Line Rule\n\n\nA \nfirst_line\n rule allows you to check whether the first line of the file\ns content matches a given regex. As with \nfile_name\n \nrules\n, the pattern is always anchored to the beginning of the line.\n\n\n{\nfirst_line\n:\n \n^\n\\\\?xml\n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinary (Shebang)\n\n\nA \nbinary\n rule does the same thing as a \nfirst_line\n rule that uses a regex to match a shebang.  The difference being that ApplySyntax will construct the regex for you.\n\n\nSo a \nfirst_line\n rule:\n\n\n{\nfirst_line\n:\n \n^#\\\\!(?:.+)ruby\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan be simplified as:\n\n\n{\nbinary\n:\n \nruby\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction Rule\n\n\nThis is an example of using a custom function to decide whether or not to apply a syntax. The source file should be in a plugin folder. \nname\n is the function name and \nsource\n is the file in which the function is contained; you must include the package it resides in, all sub-folders leading to the file, and the actual file name (extension not needed as it is assumed to be a python file).\n\n\nWhen this function is called, the full file path of the given file will be passed to it as the only argument. You are free to do whatever you want in your function, just return \nTrue\n or \nFalse\n to indicate whether a match was made.  But please be conscious of keeping it quick and light if possible.\n\n\n{\nfunction\n:\n \n{\nname\n:\n \nis_rails_file\n,\n \nsource\n:\n \nApplySyntax/is_rails_file\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nWhen placing a function rule module in a package, it is advised to put it in a sub-folder.  The sub-folder does not need an \n__init__.py\n, it just needs your module(s).\n\n\n\n\nContent Rule\n\n\nSometimes a filename or first line search is just not enough and maybe a function rule is overkill.  In this case, maybe searching the content of a file can be enough.  You can search a file\ns content with regex for a specific token via the \ncontains\n rule.\n\n\n{\ncontains\n:\n \nscript [^\n]*type=\\\ntext\\\\/x-handlebars\\\n[^\n]*\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIt is recommended to pair \ncontains\n rules with other rules via the \nmatch\n:\n \nall\n option to ensure you don\nt search every file (which can significantly slow down the editor); this will also help ensure get more reliable matches. If pairing with other rules as dependencies, it is advised to pair the \ncontains\n rule after the other required rule(s) to ensure you search the content of as few files as possible.\n\n\nAlso, try to use very specific regex to ensure you don\nt get false positives.\n\n\n\n\nProject Specific Rules\n\n\nTo define project specific syntaxes, just add \nproject_syntaxes\n to your project file.  \nproject_syntaxes\n is an array; just add your syntax rules to \nproject_syntaxes\n just like you would add them to \nsyntaxes\n in your user settings file, and ApplySyntax will append the rules to the end of your globally defined rules.\n\n\nThere is one difference between project specific rules and global rules.  In project rules, the \nextensions\n key will be ignored, as the extension feature adds extensions globally, and project specific rules are meant to be confined to the project scope.\n\n\n    \nproject_syntaxes\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nname\n:\n \nXML/XML\n,\n\n            \nrules\n:\n \n[\n\n                \n{\nfile_name\n:\n \n.*\\\\.xml(\\\\.dist)?$\n},\n\n                \n{\nfirst_line\n:\n \n^\n\\\\?xml\n}\n\n            \n]\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSettings Options\n\n\nThere are a couple of general settings found in `ApplySyntax.sublime-settings.\n\n\nRe-Raise Exceptions\n\n\nIf an exception occurs when processing a function, this will re-raised the captured exception in Sublime\ns console so the user get feedback. This is really only useful to those writing functions. The average user shouldn\nt need this.  By default, the setting will be set to \nfalse\n.\n\n\n    \nreraise_exceptions\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew File Syntax\n\n\nIf you want to have a syntax applied when new files are created, set \nnew_file_syntax\n to the name of the syntax to use. The format is exactly the same as the \nname\n parameter in the syntax rules mentioned earlier. For example, if you want to have a new file use JavaScript syntax, set \nnew_file_syntax\n to \nJavaScript/JavaScript\n.  The default is \nfalse\n.\n\n\n    \nnew_file_syntax\n:\n \nJavaScript/JavaScript\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Extensions to Language Settings\n\n\nTo enable adding defined extensions to language settings, just set \nadd_exts_to_lang_settings\n to \ntrue\n.  See \nExtensions\n for more info.\n\n\n    \nadd_exts_to_lang_settings\n:\n \ntrue\n,",

So a  first_line  rule:  { first_line :   ^#\\\\!(?:.+)ruby }   Can be simplified as:  { binary :   ruby }   Function Rule  This is an example of using a custom function to decide whether or not to apply a syntax. The source file should be in a plugin folder.  name  is the function name and  source  is the file in which the function is contained; you must include the package it resides in, all sub-folders leading to the file, and the actual file name (extension not needed as it is assumed to be a python file).  When this function is called, the full file path of the given file will be passed to it as the only argument. You are free to do whatever you want in your function, just return  True  or  False  to indicate whether a match was made.  But please be conscious of keeping it quick and light if possible.  { function :   { name :   is_rails_file ,   source :   ApplySyntax/is_rails_file }}    Tip  When placing a function rule module in a package, it is advised to put it in a sub-folder.  The sub-folder does not need an  __init__.py , it just needs your module(s).   Content Rule  Sometimes a filename or first line search is just not enough and maybe a function rule is overkill.  In this case, maybe searching the content of a file can be enough.  You can search a file s content with regex for a specific token via the  contains  rule.  { contains :   script [^ ]*type=\\ text\\\\/x-handlebars\\ [^ ]* }    Tip  It is recommended to pair  contains  rules with other rules via the  match :   all  option to ensure you don t search every file (which can significantly slow down the editor); this will also help ensure get more reliable matches. If pairing with other rules as dependencies, it is advised to pair the  contains  rule after the other required rule(s) to ensure you search the content of as few files as possible.  Also, try to use very specific regex to ensure you don t get false positives.",

There is one difference between project specific rules and global rules.  In project rules, the  extensions  key will be ignored, as the extension feature adds extensions globally, and project specific rules are meant to be confined to the project scope.       project_syntaxes :   [ \n         { \n             name :   XML/XML , \n             rules :   [ \n                 { file_name :   .*\\\\.xml(\\\\.dist)?$ }, \n                 { first_line :   ^ \\\\?xml } \n             ] \n         } \n     ]",

Re-Raise Exceptions  If an exception occurs when processing a function, this will re-raised the captured exception in Sublime s console so the user get feedback. This is really only useful to those writing functions. The average user shouldn t need this.  By default, the setting will be set to  false .       reraise_exceptions :   false ,   New File Syntax  If you want to have a syntax applied when new files are created, set  new_file_syntax  to the name of the syntax to use. The format is exactly the same as the  name  parameter in the syntax rules mentioned earlier. For example, if you want to have a new file use JavaScript syntax, set  new_file_syntax  to  JavaScript/JavaScript .  The default is  false .       new_file_syntax :   JavaScript/JavaScript ,   Add Extensions to Language Settings  To enable adding defined extensions to language settings, just set  add_exts_to_lang_settings  to  true .
